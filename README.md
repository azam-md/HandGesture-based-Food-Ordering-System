# HandGesture-based-Food-Ordering-System
The hand gesture-based food ordering system addresses
several critical issues in the realm of dining and customer
service. First, it tackles the challenge of language barriers
and communication difficulties between customers and
restaurant staff, which can often lead to order inaccuracies
and misunderstandings. By enabling customers to place
orders using intuitive hand gestures, the system eliminates
the need for verbal communication, ensuring accurate and
seamless transactions
      
Secondly, the system enhances accessibility for
individuals with speech impairments or those who may face
challenges in verbally communicating their orders. This
inclusivity ensures that all patrons can quickly and
confidently place their orders without relying on external
assistance.
